/**
 * Date: 5th July, 2025
 * Problem Statement: Two Sum II â€“ Input Array is Sorted
 * We are given a sorted array of integers (in non-decreasing order) and a target integer.
 * Our task is to find two numbers such that they add up to the target,
 * and return their 1-based indices as an array [index1, index2].
 * Constraints:
 *      There is exactly one solution.
 *      You must use only constant extra space.
 *      Indices must be 1-based, not 0-based.
 * Example 1:
 *      numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
 *      result: [1, 2]
 *      Explanation: 2 + 7 = 9
 * Example 2:
 *      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 9, 56, 90], target = 8
 *      result: [4, 5]
 *      Explanation: 4 + 8 = 8
