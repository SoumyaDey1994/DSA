/**
 * Date: 14th April, 2025
 * Problem Statement: Word Ladder Problem (BFS)
 * You are given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a wordList (a dictionary of valid words). 
 * The goal is to transform beginWord into endWord by changing only one letter at a time, 
 * ensuring that each transformed word exists in wordList.
 * ðŸ”¹ Constraints:
 *  Every transformation must be in the wordList.
 *  Only one letter can be changed at a time.
 *  Find the shortest transformation sequence length from beginWord to endWord.
 *  If no valid transformation exists, return 0.
 * Example 1:
 *      beginWord = "hit"
        endWord = "cog"
        wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
      Output: 5
      Explanation: hit â†’ hot â†’ dot â†’ dog â†’ cog (5 words in the sequence)
  * Example 2:
        beginWord = "abc"
        endWord = "xyz"
        wordList = ["abd", "axc", "ayz", "xyz"]
       Output: 4
       Explanation: abc â†’ axc â†’ ayz â†’ xyz (Length: 4)
