/**

 * Problem Statement: Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days
 * Given an array weights where weights[i] represents the weight of the i-th package.
 * A ship can carry packages in order (i.e., it cannot reorder them),
 * and we must ship all packages within D days.
 * Find the minimum ship capacity (weight limit) required so that
 * all packages can be shipped within D days.
 * Example 1:
 *      weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
 *      D = 5
 *      output: 15
 *      Explanation:
 *          One possible way to split the packages into 5 days is:
 *              [1,2,3,4,5] | [6,7] | [8] | [9] | [10]
 *          Each subarray represents a dayâ€™s shipment. Hence capacity is 15
 * Example 2:
 *      weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4];
 *      D = 3
 *      output: 6
 *      Explanation:
 *          The minimum capacity required is 6, and one way to split is:
 *              [3,2] | [2,4] | [1,4]
