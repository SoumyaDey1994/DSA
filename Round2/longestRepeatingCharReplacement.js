/**
 * Date: 5th May, 2025
 * Problem Statement: Longest Repeating Character Replacement
 * Given a string s and an integer k, you can replace at most k characters in the string.
 * Your task is to find the length of the longest substring
 * that can be obtained where all the characters are the same after performing at most k replacements.
 * âœ… Constraints
 *      Only uppercase English letters (A-Z).
 *      You are allowed to replace any character with any other character.
 *      Replace at most k characters.
 * Example 1:
 *      Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
 *      Output: 4
 *      Explanation: Replace the two 'B's with 'A's => "AAAA", length = 4.
 * Example 2:
 *      Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
 *      Output: 4
 *      Explanation:
 *          Change one 'A' at index 1 to 'B' => "ABBBBA"
 *          OR
 *          Change one 'B' to 'A' => "AAAABA"
 *          Either way, max length = 4.
 * Example 3:
 *      Input: s = "ABCDE", k = 2
 *      Output: 3
 *      Explanation: You can replace 2 letters to make "AAA", "BBB", etc.
