/**
 * Date: 14th March, 2025
 * Problem Statement: House Painting
 * We are given N houses in a row and K colors to paint them. 
 * The first and last house colors are pre-decided. 
 * They may or may not be the same. 
 * The rule is: No two adjacent houses can have the same color.
 * Find the total number of valid ways to paint all houses while following these constraints.
 * Example 1:
 *      N = 4 (houses), K = 3 (colors)
 *      First house color = 1, Last house color = 2
 *      Output: Total valid ways = 3
 *      Explanation of ways:
 *              1 2 3 2, 1 2 1 2, 1 3 1 2 - Total(3)
 * Example 2:
 *      N = 4 (houses: 1,2,3,4), K = 3 (colors: 1,2,3)
 *      First house color = 1, Last house color = 2
 *      Output: Total valid ways = 2
 *      Explanation ways:
 *              1 2 3 1, 1 3 2 1 - Total(2)
 * Example 3:
 *      N = 3 (houses: 1,2,3), K = 2 (colors: 1,2)
 *      First house color = 1, Last house color = 1
 *      Output: Total valid ways = 1
 *      Explanation ways:
 *              1 2 1 - Total(1)
 * Example 4:
 *      N = 3 (houses: 1,2,3), K = 2 (colors: 1,2)
 *      First house color = 1, Last house color = 2
 *      Output: Total valid ways = 0
 *      Explanation ways: No option as middle house can't be with color 1 or 2
