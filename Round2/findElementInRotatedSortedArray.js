/**
 * Date: 6th March, 2025
 * Problem Statement: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 * You are given a sorted array that has been rotated at some pivot unknown to you. 
 * Your task is to determine if a given target number exists in the array and return its index. 
 * If it does not exist, return -1. The array does not contain duplicates.

ğŸ”¹ Constraints:
    The array was originally sorted in ascending order before rotation.
    Your solution should run in O(log N) time complexity.

    Example 1:
        ğŸ”¹ Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
        ğŸ”¹ Output: 4
        ğŸ”¹ Explanation: The number 0 is at index 4.
    Example 2:
        ğŸ”¹ Input: nums = [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5], target = 3
        ğŸ”¹ Output: 5
        ğŸ”¹ Explanation: The number 3 is at index 5.
    Example 3 (Target Not Present):
        ğŸ”¹ Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8,1,2], target = 9
        ğŸ”¹ Output: -1
        ğŸ”¹ Explanation: 9 is not in the array, so return -1.
