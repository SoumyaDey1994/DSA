 * Efficient Janitor Problem - DSA Explanation
 * Problem Statement:
 * A janitor has to carry garbage bags, and each bag has a weight between 1.01 and 3.00 kilograms.
 * The janitor can carry at most N kg in one trip.
 * Find the minimum number of trips required to move all the garbage bags.
 * Example 1:
 *      N: 3.0
 *      Input: [1.50, 1.99, 2.50, 1.01, 2.30] 
 *      Output: 3 trips
 *      Explanation: 
            1st trip: (1.01 + 1.99) = 3.00  
            2nd trip: (1.50 alone)
            3rd trip: (2.30 alone)
            4th trip: (2.50 alone)
 * Example 2:
 *      Input: [1.20, 1.80, 2.40, 2.00, 1.00]
 *      Output: 3 trips
 *      Explanation:  
            1st trip: (1.00 + 2.00) = 3.00  
            2nd trip: (1.20 + 1.80) = 3.00  
            3rd trip: (2.40 alone)
 * Example 3:
 *      Input: [2.90, 2.80, 2.70, 1.50]
 *      Output: 4 trips
 *      Explanation: Each heavy bag has to be taken alone.
