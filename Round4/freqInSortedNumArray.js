 * Problem Statement: Find Frequency in a Sorted Number Array
 * Given a sorted array of numbers and a target number.
 * Your task is to find the frequency (count of occurrences) of the target number in the array.
 * ðŸ’¡ Constraints:
 *      The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *      The target number may or may not be present in the array.
 *      We need to determine the number of times the target appears efficiently.
 * Example 1:
 *      arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
 *      target = 2;
 *      output: 3
 *      Explanation: 2 appears three times in the array
 * Example 2:
 *      arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1];
 *      target = 1;
 *      output: 6
 *      Explanation: 2 appears three times in the array
 * Example 2:
 *      arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
 *      target = 5;
 *      output: 0
 *      Explanation: 5 is not in the array
