/**
 * Date: 3rd Match, 2025
 * Problem Statement
 * Given two strings s and t, return the smallest substring of s that contains all characters of t.
 * If no such substring exists, return an empty string "".
 * Example 1:
 *      Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
        Output: "BANC"
        Explanation: The shortest substring containing 'A', 'B', and 'C' is "BANC".
 * Example 2:
        Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
        Output: ""
        Explanation: The character 'a' appears only once in `s`, so no valid substring exists.
